I am a strategy and AI hardware professional transitioning to research in **neuromorphic computing** and **embodied social intelligence for robots**. At Mobilint (edge AI NPU startup), I led roadmap and PoC efforts for deploying NPUs in mission-critical robots, which exposed the practical limits of dense, pre-trained inference on resource-constrained platforms. This experience motivates my research on **end-to-end neuromorphic vision** and **on-device learning** that enable long-duration autonomy.

Previously, I worked with multinational teams at Intel and founded a startup, building a cross-disciplinary background that spans semiconductor strategy, model benchmarking (GPU/NPU), and human-computer interaction. I studied **Cognitive Science** at UC Berkeley and am preparing for graduate study focusing on neuromorphic methods for robust perception in the wild.

**Research interests.** Neuromorphic computing • Event-based vision • Predictive coding • On-device/online learning • Human–robot interaction • Energy-efficient AI systems.

**Personal projects.**
- *Social Intention from Minimal Cues*: classification of pedestrian intentions (help/stop/neutral/greeting) and cue-aware perception for embodied agents. [Projects »](/portfolio/)
- *NPU-centric Edge LLM & sLLM Acceleration*: lightweight generation and compilation across edge NPUs. [Notes »](/posts/)
- *Benchmarking for Robots*: throughput/latency/power profiling across GPU/NPU for robotic workloads. [Summary »](/files/benchmark_summary.pdf)

    <p>I am a strategist and national researcher working in AI chip startup Mobilint, with research interest in implementing <strong>embodied social intelligence</strong> of robots <strong> from bio-inspired perspective</strong>. In my role, I work closely with SoC and algorithm teams to plan next-generation AI chips, commercialize NPU-based computing solutions, and execute proof-of-concepts with various industry partners to replace GPU into low power, high performance NPU solutions. My latest project is working on strategies for plannning ultra high-performance AI SoC targeting humanoids.</p>

    <p>Previously, I worked at Intel as one of the youngest Chief of Staff and Technical Assistant to Head of Samsung Global Account, building a cross-disciplinary background across semiconductor value chain. In this role, I was given unique opportunity to work on projects on adopting Intel CPUs to various edge devices including AI PCs, AI ultrasound devices, 5G vRAN equiptment, AI robot vacuum cleaner. I also worked on C-level AI Taskforce with Samsung Memory.</p>

    <p><strong>Research interests.</strong> Neuromorphic computing · Event-based vision · Predictive coding · On-device/online learning · Human–robot interaction · Energy-efficient AI systems.</p>

    <p>I am a strategist and national researcher at <strong>Mobilint</strong>, an AI chip startup, with a research interest in developing <strong>embodied social intelligence for robots</strong> from a bio-inspired perspective. I work closely with SoC and algorithm teams to plan next-generation AI chips, commercialize NPU-based computing solutions, and lead proof-of-concepts with industry partners to replace GPUs with low-power, high-performance NPUs. My latest project involves strategies for an <em>ultra-high-performance AI SoC</em> targeting humanoid robots.</p>

    <p>Previously, I was one of the youngest <strong>Chief of Staff and Technical Assistant</strong> to the Head of Samsung Global Account at Intel, building a cross-disciplinary background across the semiconductor value chain. In this role, I contributed to projects integrating Intel CPUs into AI PCs, ultrasound devices, 5G vRAN equipment, and robotic systems, and participated in C-level AI taskforces with Samsung Memory.</p>
